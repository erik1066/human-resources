I also served as CFO for Youhalf, Inc., the leading half-finding company in the United States. I played a key role in taking Youhalf public in 2008 and reaching over $500M in revenue before being acquired by Terminator Equity Partners. I also held leadership roles at SupportIt and Offendme, LLP. Outside of work, I stay busy spending time with four daughters, hang-gliding, or training for another marathon. I hold a BS in Accounting from Georgia Tech.",
